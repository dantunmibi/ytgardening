YOU MUST CREATE A SCRIPT ABOUT ONE OF THESE REAL TRENDING GARDENING TOPICS:

{chr(10).join(trending_summaries)}

These are REAL trends from today ({datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}) collected from:
- Google Trends (real gardening search data)
- Gardening RSS feeds (latest headlines from Fine Gardening, Savvy Gardening, etc.)
- Reddit gardening communities (r/gardening, r/houseplants, etc.)

YOU MUST PICK ONE OF THE 5 TOPICS ABOVE. 
DO NOT create content about anything else.
DO NOT make up your own topic.
USE THE EXACT TREND and expand it into a viral gardening script.

If a trend is about "propagating pothos", your script MUST be about that specific plant propagation method.
If a trend is about "tomato blight solutions", your script MUST be about that exact problem and solution.
